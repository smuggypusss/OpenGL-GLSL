The main Project file is Win32Project1.cpp which constantly changes when trying different stuff, this is a visual studio project here I can only run one main module which is this file all other cannot be executed in the project, in this repo branch I have created separate cpp fies for different things that I have tried out in OpenGL.
For ex Blank Screen.cpp when I run it shows a blank screen
Note: stdafx.cpp is a necessary library in order for opengl to work in Visual Studio 2015, I have migrated this project to 2022 version but since I have this library in hand I have not excluded it yet.
